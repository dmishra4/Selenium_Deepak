My last project was very enormous and challenging named Smart Collection which was based on Credit Risk Management and Regulation.

There are three type of risk in Bank.
1. Credit Risk
2. Market Risk
3. Operational Risk.

Actually, client was using delinquent users allocation among of all collectors through Manual and it was tedious process and usually taking minium 2-3 days time to complete it.

Stakeholders need was to replace current system with the advance system called Smart collection in oder to do repleace manual allocation from automation. 

I have talked with SME and came to knwo that it is getting impacted all the big portfoli like Car leasing, ConsumerFinance, Real estate, In-House Recovery


Issues : Expired contract was getting allocated to collectors.
Not delinquent but still was displaying delnquent under old collection.
Delinquent but not dislaying under old collection.


Requirement Change :  Create different campaign for Government and Private sector customer.
                      Write off change from 360 to 180.

Regulations : CRA (Capital Adiquency Ratio) must be 8%

RWA (Risk Weight Asset ) : Avarage of all kind of risks.
