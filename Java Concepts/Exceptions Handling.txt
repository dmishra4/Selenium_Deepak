#####3Difference between checked and unchecked exception ########

There are few exceptions which are checked by compiler for the smooth execution of progrem and ensure whether programmer handleded or not : Checked Compiler.

Example : FileNotFoundException

Exception which are not checked by compiler for smooth exceution 


********** Whether exception is checked or inchecked compulsory it will occor only at Runtime There is no chance of occuring any exception at compile time.


******* Runtime exception and its child , error and it's child classes are unchecked exception except this remaining are checked exceptions.



Throw : The main object of the throw keyword is to handover our created exception object to JVM manually.

throw new AE("/ by zero")


***  An unexpected unwamted event that disturbs the normal flow of program is called exception.

tyrepuntureException
sleepingException
filenotfoundException

The main objective of exception handling is graceful termination of program

###### 

Exception handling does not mean repairing an exception , we have to provide alternative way to continue the rest of program normally is the concept of exception handling.

For example : Our programming requirment is to read data from Remote file located at london. At run time if remote file is not available our program should not be abnormally.

We have to provide some local file to continue, rest of the program normally. This way of defining alternavtive is nothing but exception handling.


######Exception : Exceptions are caused by our program and recoverable.

######Error : Most of time error are not caused by our program and these are due to lack of system resources.Hence, Error occurs due to lack of resources. it is non recovrable.
example : if Outofmemory error occurs and being a programmer we can't do any thing and program will be terminated abnormally.

*** System admin or server admin responsible to increase heap memory.
