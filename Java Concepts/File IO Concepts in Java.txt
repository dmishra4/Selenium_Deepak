I have very rich knowledge of mostly all prominent autimation tools.


#### Constructor ##################
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filepath);
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File file);    // file reference

int read(). It attempt to read next character from the file and return it's UNICODE value. If the next character is not available then this method return -1

As this method returns UNICODE value ( int value) , at the time of prinitng we have to perform type casting


############# Example############
FileReader fr = new FileReader("abc.text");
int i = fr.read();
while(i!=1)
{
System.out.println(char(i)); // Type casting is done here to chance int unicode value to characters
   i=fr.read();
}

############################# Method
 int read(char[] ch)
it attemps to read enough characters from the file into file array and returns number of characters copied from the file.

File f = new File(
char[] ch = new char[(int)fr.length()]
FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);  // either file path or file reference
fr.read(ch) // it will read all characters in file and put into ch array character

for ( char ch1 : ch)
{
Syso(ch1);

}
