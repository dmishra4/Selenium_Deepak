Type csting Tyep

A b  = (C)d;

converting d type of object into C type object. After doing this right side type become C type.
Then we are asigning to A type reference varable.

Here two check will be done by compiler and one by JVM.

1. Right side conversion is legal or not
Type of d and C must have some relation. Parent to child, child to parent and same type.
2. Left side conversion is legal or not.
type C must be same as A or child type.

Object 0 = new String("Durga");  // Line 1
StringBuffer sb = (String)0; // Line 2

Here String is not child of String Buffer so it will give compiler error i.e String can't to converted to String Buffer.



Base b = new der4();
Object o = (der3)b;

// During run time, JVM will check whether der4 and der3 are same type or der4 is child of der3;



####################
At a time of declaration, we can mention the sie otherwise we will get the compile time error.

int[6] x ;  // Invalid
int[]  x;   // Valid
