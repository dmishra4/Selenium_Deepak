1. Polymorphism is a concept in which we can perform single action in different ways.

2. There are two types of Polymerphism .
a> Compile Time Polymerphism (Overloading)
b> Run time Polymorphism ( Overrides).

3. Upcasitng : If reference variable of object class refers object of the child class, it is known as Upcasting.
 

4.   class P
{

}

class C extends P
{
}


P p = new C();
Here p is reference variable of Parent Class.

Right side part is Object of Child class

4. Upcasitng : If reference variable of object class refers object of the child class, it is known as Upcasting.

5. In overriding, Method invocation is done/determined  by JVM not compiler , then it is called runtime Polymerphism.

6. In overloading , Method resolution always takes care by compiler based on reference type.
In overloading, run time object will not play any role .
