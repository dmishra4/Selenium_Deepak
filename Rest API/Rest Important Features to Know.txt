We have just scratched the surface of REST Assured. There are several more features that can be used for REST testing:
1.Validating JSON responses according to a schema,
2.Working with XML data instead of JSON,
3.Using Groovy closures or Java 8 lambdas for validating responses,
4.Working with HTTP headers,
5.Working with cookies,
6.Posting form parameters,
7.Using timeouts in tests,
8.Testing different authentication methods and SSL, and
9.Writing custom (de)serializers.
