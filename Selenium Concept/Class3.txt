Interface does not have body. 

We can't create object for interface.

WebDriver is interface in JAVA

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();// here object can use method mentioned under WebDriver interface.

FrifoxDriver driver 1 = new FirefoxDriver();  // Here object can access method mentioned under webdriver as well as defined under FifefoxDriver class.

.//*[@id='gs_htif0']

Primarly

IDE ..we can run any line but that is not possible in WebDriver. WEbDriver wil execute the whole command 

//div[contains(@class, 'MocG8c B9IrJb LMgvRb')]

//content[@class='vRMGwf oJeWuf']

import org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor
